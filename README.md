# Spinning-Cow
I'll give you one guess. 
I learned basic 3D projection, where every vertex is rendered. No I did not model a cow by typing in those points, they came from an OBJ file,
and you can import your own models by using the create_vertex_buffer function. I mainly just wanted this all to be one file, so I just copy-pasted 
the cow vertex buffer into the original code.
